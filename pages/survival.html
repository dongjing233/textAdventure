            the house next door makes me sad.<br>
            the people are nice people, <br>
            I like them.<br>
<br>
            but I feel them drowning.<br>
            and I can't save them.<br>
<br>
            they are surviving.<br>
            they are not<br>
            homeless.<br>
<br>
            but the price is<br>
            terrible.<br>
<br>
            sometimes during the day<br>
            I will look at the house<br>
            and the house will look at<br>
            me<br>
            and the house will<br>
            weep, yes, it does, I<br>
            feel it.<br>
